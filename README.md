# Description

A fully configurable mod that detects Control Company by giving you an in-game warning, marking lobbies that have it and detecting when the host spawns an enemy indoors. It can also hide or only show said lobbies.

# Manually spawned enemies detection

If the Detect enemy spawning option is enabled (which it is by default) and the host has spawned an enemy, the mod will give you a warning with the enemy's name.

If you host a lobby with Detect enemy spawning as host enabled, a different warning will appear to indicate that an enemy has been spawned by someone else. This means that enemies that have been spawned using cheats or other mods will be detected.

Here's a full list of all the enemies the mod is able to detect:

- Spore lizard
- Hoarding bug / Loot bug
- Slime / Hygrodere
- Snare flea
- Spider
- Thumper
- Bracken
- Coil-Head
- Masked / Mimic
- Nutcracker
- Jester
- Lasso man
- Obunga

### WARNING:
Any mods that alter how indoor enemies spawn will cause this feature to not work properly
