# Description

A fully configurable mod that gives you an in-game warning when a lobby host is using Control Company and when they spawn an indoor enemy. It can also hide lobbies that use it.

# Manually spawned enemies detection

If the Detect Enemy Spawning option is enabled (which it is by default) and the host has spawned an enemy, the mod will give you a warning with the enemy's name.

Here's a full list of all the enemies the mod is able to detect:

- Spore lizard
- Hoarding bug / Loot bug
- Slime / Hygrodere
- Snare flea
- Spider
- Thumper
- Bracken
- Coil-Head
- Masked / Mimic
- Nutcracker
- Jester
- Lasso man

Keep in mind that this feature doesn't only work with Control Company, as it will detect any enemy that has been spawned by any player as long as the enemy is in the list.
This means that enemies that have been spawned using cheats or other mods will also be detected.

**WARNING:**
Any mods that alter how indoor enemies spawn will most likely cause this feature to not work properly
