# Description

A fully configurable mod that gives you an in-game warning when a lobby host is using Control Company and when they're controlling an enemy indoors. It can also hide lobbies that use it.

# Controlled enemies detection

If the Detect Enemy Control option is enabled (which it is by default) and the host has spawned an enemy, the mod will give you a warning with the enemy's name.

Here's a full list of all the enemies the mod is able to detect:

- Spore lizard
- Hoarding bug / Loot bug
- Slime / Hygrodere
- Snare flea
- Spider
- Thumper
- Bracken
- Coil-Head
- Nutcracker
- Jester
- Lasso man (yes, it can also detect it)
